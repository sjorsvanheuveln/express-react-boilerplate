## Lessons Learned ##
1. Read the original documents for fixing HMR
  i. https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-middleware
  ii. important: publicPath: '/javascripts/',
2. Success can be just around the corner!
3. Differense @use & @import in scss:
    a. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62757419/whats-the-difference-between-import-and-use-scss-rules
4. React Router:
  a. exact path = '/' will only! render this component on this path
  b. so /profile won't be e.g.
5. Css/Bootstrap
  a. CSS is not being purged!
  b. How to properly implement Bootstrap -> Read the Docs!
  

## To Do ##
* How to setup Redux@latest
* Load bootstrap js properly -> check if it's purged and minified

## Questions ##
1. What is the right scss setup?
2. React now demands proptypes to check props. Is this necessary?

  b. Is anti-bug/testing kind of thing. Let's ignore it for now.

### 13 May: HMR Breakthrough ###
My goodness we did it. The hardest part for now is over!
I just read the documents for webpack-hot-middleware and that was enough.
I try to strip it to its bare bones setup. It's not too much code to get it working.

Haha, and then it got immediately broken after css building, but fixed it 2 hours later.
Now, all good and integrated scss and postcss building!

### 14 May: CSS ###
ESlint is showing some annoying errors only on the desktop this morning.
Fixed it 5 minutes later.
Disabled HMR for production.
Updated Dekstop npm
  -> New major version of npm available! 6.14.12 â†’ 7.13.0 
  -> npm -v (check version)

### 15 May: How to Develop? ###
1. Doe tutorials over Bootstrap/SASS/purging
  a. Check closebrace.
  b. What is the best way to include BS (during dev)
    i. Maybe just include it in the view index for dev.
    ii. I guess reactstrap one uses just to build the functionality
      and the transitions to doing the css later.
  c. What is the best way to develop... -> css/functionality???

## Epiphanies ##
Being angry or in an angry position is just an excuse for not facing uncertainty/insecurity. It stops the creativity.
