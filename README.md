# Express-React-Boilerplate #
* Express Backend
* React Frontend
* Hot Module Reloading!!!
* Webpack (Babel transpiling)
* Requirements: Node 16.1.0

## Description ##
The MERN setup with hot-reloading without needing webpack-dev-server.

## Required Implementations ##
* Social Media login
* Invite a friend
* Delete account
* Weekly mails

## Lessons Learned ##
1. Read the original documents for fixing HMR
  * https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-middleware
  * important: publicPath: '/javascripts/',

2. Success can be just around the corner!

3. Differense @use & @import in scss:
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62757419/whats-the-difference-between-import-and-use-scss-rules

4. React Router:
  * exact path = '/' will only! render this component on this path
  * so /profile won't be e.g.

5. Css/Bootstrap
  * CSS is not being purged!
  * How to properly implement Bootstrap -> Read the Docs!

6. Passport
  * Local is a login strategy based on email & password from the local database.

7. Backend / Redux / createAsyncThunk / Error Handling:
  a. [auth.extraReducer.rejected] 
    * is triggered by: throw Error('your error message');
    * this will attach and error object into action.error
  b. response.ok = false can be triggered from the backend by:
    * es.status(400/401/etc);
  c. Basically the only thing that the backend does is returning objects!
  d. The function used inside Async Thunk is the "payloadCreator"!
    * Whatever is returned from that function is attached to action.payload
      - Which doesn't have to be an object. But preferably
  e. res.send(JSON.stringify({})) === res.json({})
    though the type is set to HTML/text in send
  f. Models 
    * model.find: -> returns an empty array with no results
    * model.findOne: -> returns null with no results



## To Do ##
* Expand Passport to Socials

## Questions ##
1. React now demands proptypes to check props. Is this necessary?
  a. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqwAw9ByRUw
  b. Is anti-bug/testing kind of thing. Let's ignore it for now.
2. React Router can't reload pages where a nested route doesn't exist.
  -> /account/login won't be reloaded as /account doesn't exist.
3. How to combine Passport strategies.
4. So logging in basically just getting a user object from the database into the state.
  -> Can't the state be hacked in a way through insertion of some kind?

### 13 May: HMR Breakthrough ###
My goodness we did it. The hardest part for now is over!
I just read the documents for webpack-hot-middleware and that was enough.
I try to strip it to its bare bones setup. It's not too much code to get it working.

Haha, and then it got immediately broken after css building, but fixed it 2 hours later.
Now, all good and integrated scss and postcss building!

### 14 May: CSS ###
ESlint is showing some annoying errors only on the desktop this morning.
Fixed it 5 minutes later.
Disabled HMR for production.
Updated Dekstop npm
  -> New major version of npm available! 6.14.12 â†’ 7.13.0 
  -> npm -v (check version)

### 15 May: How to Develop? ###
1. Doe tutorials over Bootstrap/SASS/purging
  a. Check closebrace.
  b. What is the best way to include BS (during dev)
    i. Maybe just include it in the view index for dev.
    ii. I guess reactstrap one uses just to build the functionality
      and the transitions to doing the css later.
  c. What is the best way to develop... -> css/functionality???

### 17 May: Lazy ###
Hard to start today. Don't know how to proceed? I don't have the css
purging figured out yet. But perhaps I don't need to know that now.
1. Basically it is already sort of purging, but not yet fully optimal.
  -> Let's move on!

### 20 May: Continued after Lazy ###
1. Fixed bootstrap/css hotreloading + found a workable quick setup for dev and css quick compiling
2. Reactstrap only works with bootstrap 4. -> not bad, just for dev purposes!
3. Added 2FA for github. Now need to use personal access tokens.
  * No password required no more.
4. Implemented login stuff.
5. Error Page handling.

### 22 May: Work = Great ###
Just start and it will flow!
Did a lot of login stuff and most of it I understand.

### 24 May: ... ###
1. Is it ok to return salts and hashes?
  * Why is the password not send back by default (what controls that?)
2. Session needs to persist a log in user.

### 25 May: PUSH ###
I always think I'm not gonna figure it out. But I should assume things are possible and I could understand them. Today I was able to apply my own login-redux setup through redux-thunks. Took a while, but now it's working the way I want it. I continue the road for understandable, readable DRY code.

1. Check and experiment with the error handlers.
2. Refactor logout to the slice file!
3. Are React.components refactorable to useState functionalities?

### 26 May: Natural Resistance ###
Always takes me time to start. But once I start it's good.
Build Registration Succes Page
Checksession non-user login problem fixed.

### 27 May: Difficult ###
I need to push on to understand this fucking redux async stuff.
I should be able to figure it out!!!!
It's difficult now!!! Keep struggling!
IVO style photosynthese here we go!

I could move the error dispatches to the rejected action.

to do:
1. Error Handling:
  * on logout
  * implement clearError
2. Form Validation
3. There probably is a better way of handling errors with createAsync!!!
  -> Yes, there should be!!!!

### 28 May: Experimentation ###
Do some more experimenting with how the asyncThunk works.
I think the dispatch(failure) is already triggering the login.rejected procedure!
Because I can just return from the login-error {username: 'nonsense'} and I'll have it working.
Ideal would be to handle the error in login.rejected!!!

4. Figure out how passport works. Passport throws a 401 as a response I think.
Is setting redux states safe? Maybe there should be authentication on the premium pages.
Should premium be an auth->thingy?

-> Yes Passport output a res.statusCode = 200 for succes 401 for unauthorized.

## Epiphanies ##
Being angry or in an angry position is just an excuse for not facing uncertainty/insecurity. It stops the creativity.
